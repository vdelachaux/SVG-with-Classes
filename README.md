# SVG with Classes

After creating and using the [4D SVG component](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19/4D/19/4D-SVG-Component. 100-5461938.en.html), I realized the need to create a more concise, faster, and SVG-like API for managing user interfaces and simplifying SVG image/document manipulation. The main goal was to reduce code complexity for SVG image/document creation and manipulation. 

This repository includes:

* The component source code
* The built and signed component
* A test project that provides code examples and “How do I” guides


The content will be augmented according to my needs but I strongly encouraged you to enrich this project through [pull request](https://github.com/vdelachaux/SVG-with-Classes/pulls). This can only benefit the [4D developer community](https://discuss.4d.com/search?q=4D%20for%20iOS). 

* The `svg` class simplifies the creation and manipulation of the SVG elements thanks to a set of simple functions and some automatisms, and decrease the number of variables needed. 

* The `chart` class is a very succinct implementation of the SVG chart types I needed. More could be done ;-)

For more details on properties and functions, see the class documentation:

* [svg class](SVG-with-Classes/Documentation/Classes/svg.md)
* [chart class](SVG-with-Classes/Documentation/Classes/chart.md)

The component is compatible with the [Project Dependencies](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Project/components#monitoring-project-dependencies) feature. You can easily integrate it into your project by selecting Design > Project Dependencies and adding vdelachaux/SVG-with-Classes as the repository address in the dedicated dialog box. I suggest setting the rule to “Follow 4D version.”  **This way, you can benefit from updates over time.**
